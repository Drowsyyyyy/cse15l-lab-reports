1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
Answer: ![Image](without argument.PNG)
Working directory: Home directory.
Explanation: The ls command without arguments just lists files and directories in a plain format which is lecture1 in this case.
The cat command without arguments waits for an input from my keyboard. So, when I typed adsfads, the cat command prints adsfads as it is.
Lastly, the cd command without arguments drives us to home directory. Therefore, if we are in home directory when we put the cd command, the cd command changes nothing. 
Error: N/A

2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
Answer: ![Image](with argument.PNG)
Working directory: Home directory. 
Explanation: The cd command with a directory as an argument drives us to that directory declared as an argument. For example, in this case, I used lecture1 directory as an argument so the cd command drives me from home directory to lecture1 directory.
The cat command with a directory as an argument prints a message whether we can discriminate the declared argument is a directory. In this case, since the argument lecture1 is a directory, the cat command printed the message that "cat: lecture1: Is a directory".
The ls command with a directory as an argument lists all files and directories in the declared arugment. If "ls lecture1" is declared, the command lists all directories and files in the lecture1 directory which are messages, Hello.class, Hello.java, and README. 
Error: N/A
